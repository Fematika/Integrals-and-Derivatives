# Integrals-and-Derivatives
An approximation of the integrals and derivatives of functions
This is a program that approximates the derivative and integral of a function using the standard definition of the derivative and the approcimation via the Riemann sum of the function. Granted, the latter is not the actual definition of the integral, but it is widely accepted that it works very well, and is much easier to progam.

This code is a test to see how well I can program and make it intelligable without making it lengthy. I will post this on reddit to see the responses of how well the code is written. This is not meant to be impressive or useful, instead as a way to practice my function syntax and get the best results out.

Thank you!
